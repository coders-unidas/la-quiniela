<h2 style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> 1. Introduction</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model 
simulating a <em>Quiniela</em> game using historical data from <em>LaLiga</em>. The model can give you the predictions
of the results of the matches for a given match day in a certain division an season.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">
The main objective is to give the model <em>features</em> so they can predict an outcome, called <em>target</em>. The model 
is trained with data from those <em>features</em> and in which <em>target</em> did they result. Once the model is trained, 
if new <em>features</em> are introduced, it will predict a certain <em>target</em>.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> In the case of this project, the <em>target</em> will be whether the home team
wins, loses or if there is a tie. The outcome of the program will be: 1 if the home team wins, 2 if the away team wins  or <em>x</em>
if there is a tie. In order to see the performance of the model, matches which the score is already already known can be predicted,
so the prediction can be compared with the reality and establish the fiability of the model. </p>

<h2 style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">2. Description of the model</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> 2.1 Features </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> We have established three candidate features for our model that are
     features related to the outcome of the matches. The first feature is which team is home team and which one is away team. 
     During the Data Analysis of <em>LaLiga</em> we observed that the team that is playing at home has more tendency to win rather than 
     team that is playing away, so we decided that it would be an interesting feature to take into consideration. In Figure 1 it can be
     seen the huge tendency there is.

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> Secondly, another thing that is quite related to which team has more
      odds of winning a match is how high or low are they in the rank position; the higher a team is positioned
       in the rank means that in the past they performed really well. So, thinking that a team with a higher rank playing against
       a team with a lower rank will win, is quite a safe bet. This is the login between why whe chose the following features: the rank 
       position from the latter position and the rank position in the current season each day (in other words, how are they positioned 
       in the rank a certain day of the season according to the matches until that day). To take into consideration the division shifts,
       we established that the rank position in division 2 is <em>N</em>+<em>n</em> (the last rank position in division 1 of the season
       plus the rank position of the team in division 2).
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">In order to choose which features we chose to develop the model, we
did three Jupyter Notebooks that can be found in the folder <em>analysis</em>.  </p>


<h3 style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> 2.2 Description of the codes </h3>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">
The model consists on 4 codes that are conected between each other, and each one has a certain role in the performance of the 
model. Here below, the 4 codes and their roles are described.

</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> - First code: <em>transform_data.py</em> </h4>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> This code was not in the initial codes given at the beginning 
     of the project. Its main goal is to, as it's implied in its name, to transform the data from the given data frame so we 
     could obtain the features that we needed to implement in our model.
